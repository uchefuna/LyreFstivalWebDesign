          <h2 id="gmb">Geroge Michael Biography</h2>
          <p>
            George Michael was born Georgios Kyriacos Panayiotou in Finchley, north London, in the United Kingdom, to
            Lesley Angold
            (Harrison), a dancer, and Kyriacos Panayiotou, a restaurateur. His father was a Greek Cypriot, and his
            mother was of
            English background. He first discovered fame as a musician when he and school friend, Andrew Ridgeley,
            formed the pop
            group Wham!. Success came fast and furious with their first album, 'Fantastic' (1983) hitting the UK number
            one spot.
            Wham! survived for five years and during that time the group notched up four number one singles and two
            number one
            albums. Most of their other releases made top three. George also contributed to the Band Aid Single 'Do They
            Know It's
            Christmas' (1984), and scored two further solo number one hits with 'Careless Whisper' and 'A Different
            Corner'.
          </p>

          <p>
            Following the break-up of Wham!, George went on to have a hugely successful career as a solo artist, his
            debut album
            'Faith' (1987) - and the single of the same name - both achieving instant and international success. The
            album has since
            been certified Diamond.
          </p>

          <p>
            Over the last four decades George has notched up 8 number one albums in the and 13 number one singles in
            the UK
            (including Wham!, Band Aid, and the 'Five Live' EP). In the U.S. he has achieved 2 number one albums and 10
            number one
            singles, with numerous other number one hits throughout the rest of the world.
          </p>

          <p>
            He has performed duets with artists including Aretha Franklin, Elton John, Queen, and Lisa Stansfield, and
            actively
            participates in charitable causes, Live Aid and the Freddie Mercury concert for AIDS being just two of the
            more
            prominent examples. According to a BBC documentary, George donated more than five million pounds towards
            various
            charities. Whilst with Wham!, he donated all the proceeds of 'Last Christmas' (1984) to charity. The single
            reached
            number two in the UK and George also performed simultaneously on the number one charity record 'Do They Know
            It's
            Christmas?'.

          <h2 id="dbb">David Bowie Biography</h2>
          <p>
            David Robert Jones was born in Brixton on January 8, 1947. At age 13, inspired by the jazz of the London
            West End, he
            picked up the saxophone and called up Ronnie Ross for lessons. Early bands he played with - The Kon-Rads,
            The King Bees,
            the Mannish Boys and the Lower Third - provided him with an introduction into the showy worlds of pop and
            mod, and by
            1966 he was David Bowie, with long hair and aspirations of stardom rustling about his head. Kenneth Pitt
            signed on as
            his manager, and his career began with a handful of mostly forgotten singles and a head full of ideas. It
            was not until
            1969 that the splash onto the charts would begin, with the legendary Space Oddity (which peaked at #5 in the
            UK). Amidst
            his musical wanderings in the late '60s, the young Bowie experimented with mixed media, cinema, mime,
            Tibetan Buddhism,
            acting and love. A first rock album, originally titled David Bowie then subsequently re-titled Man of Words,
            Man of
            Music and again as Space Oddity, paid homage to the kaleidoscopic influences of the London artistic scene,
            while hinting
            at a songwriting talent that was about to yield some of rock n roll's finest and most distinctive work--even
            if it would
            take the rest of the world a few years to catch up.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Man Who Sold The World was the first David Bowie album recorded as an entity unto itself and marks
            ground zero of
            the first definitive creative stretch to come. Mick Ronson's guitars are often referred to as the birth
            point of heavy
            metal, and certainly the auspicious beginnings of glam rock can be traced here. The album was released by
            Mercury in
            April 1971 to minimal fanfare and Bowie took his first trip to the United States to promote it that spring.
            In May of
            the same year, Duncan Zowie Haywood Bowie was born to David and his then wife Angela.
          </p>

          <p>
            RCA was the next label to sign Bowie, and after a trip to America to complete the legalities, he returned
            to London to
            record two albums nearly back to back. Hunky Dory was built from a six-song demo that had enticed the label
            to sign him
            and features Changes and Life on Mars?. Almost immediately, it was followed by the instant classic The Rise
            and Fall of
            Ziggy Stardust and The Spiders from Mars—a record without which any Greatest Albums of All Time list is
            simply
            incomplete.
          </p>

          <p>
            1972 would be the year that Bowie ascended to international superstardom. GQ UK editor Dylan Jones, for
            example, said of
            the landmark 1972 Top of The Pops appearance on 6th July where Ziggy first materialized in millions of
            unsuspecting
            living rooms performing Starman, the album's lead single, "This is the performance that turned Bowie into a
            star,
            embedding his Ziggy Stardust persona into the nation's consciousness." Previewed in London that spring,
            Bowie's
            extraterrestrial rockstar creation Ziggy Stardust staged one of the most spectacular and innovative live
            shows to date,
            expanding the parameters of the live rock show and singlehandedly launching a worldwide glam explosion.

          <h2 id="esb">Ed Sheeran Biography</h2>
          <p>
            Ed Sheeran is a singer-songwriter from Suffolk, England. Known for his hybrid pop and R&B sound, which
            mixes his soulful lyrics with his mellow voice, Ed Sheeran has found extensive fame across all corners of
            the globe.
          </p>

          <p>
            At the tender age of 14, Ed Sheeran began recording music and independently released his first collection
            of songs “The
            Orange Room EP”. It was after his move to London in 2008, though, that his music career really began to take
            off due to the release of his “Loose Change EP”, which featured future megahit single “The A Team”.
          </p>

          <p>
            Prepared to graft from the very start, Ed Sheeran played 312 gigs in 2009 in addition to constantly
            releasing new material on his YouTube channel. These gigs and his widespread social media following caught
            the attention
            of Jamie
            Foxx, Elton John and Example. Further to this, his hard work won thousands of fans, who would show up at any
            small gigs
            he was playing. Knowing they were on to a good thing, Asylum/Atlantic Records quickly signed Ed Sheeran to
            their label
            after the release of his popular “No. 5 Collaborations Project” EP.
          </p>

          <p>
            Ed Sheeran's debut studio album “+” entered at number one in the UK charts after Ed secured four top ten
            singles in a
            row from the album. An opportunity to break into the US market soon came about after Ed was given the
            opportunity to
            tour with the band Snow Patrol.
